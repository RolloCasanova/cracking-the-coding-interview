# List of Depths

Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).

## Hints

<details>
    <summary> #107 </summary>
    Try modifying a graph search algorithm to track the depth from the root.

<details>
    <summary> #123 </summary>
    A hash table or array that maps from level number to nodes at that level might also be useful.
</details>

<details>
    <summary> #135 </summary>
    You should be able to come up with an algorithm involving both depth-first search and breadth-first search.
